# Parkinson's Disease Voice Analysis

This repository contains the code and report for our investigation into using voice recordings for Parkinson's Disease detection. We explore whether vocal fundamental frequency differs between healthy individuals and those diagnosed with Parkinson's, leveraging a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our analysis includes data visualization, statistical testing (t-test), and a discussion of the potential implications for early diagnosis.

**Research Question:**

Our research question zeroes in on a key vocal characteristic affected by Parkinson’s: Does the average vocal fundamental frequency (MDVP:Fo(Hz)) differ significantly between individuals with and without Parkinson's disease (status)? This question seeks to establish if a quantifiable vocal feature can distinguish between healthy and Parkinson’s-affected individuals.
